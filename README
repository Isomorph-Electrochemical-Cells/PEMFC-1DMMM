CONTENTS

This program package consists of the following files:

MMM1D.m  --  MATLAB program file
LICENSE  --  License Agreement (BSD 3-clause)
README   --  This readme file



INSTALLATION

No installation is needed. Just open the program file in MATLAB.



EXECUTION

To run the program, open it in MATLAB and execute the function either by clicking the "Run" button on the MABLAB GUI or by typing "MMM1D;" in MATLAB's command window.



INPUT

There is no input needed for execution. To change material parameters or operating conditions, edit the source code directly.



OUTPUT

Running the program by typing "[IU, SOL] = MMM1D;" in MATLAB's command window will return the following two output data structures:

IU -- a two-column matrix containing the list of computed current densities and corresponding cell voltages (i.e., the polarization curve) of the fuel cell

SOL -- a cell array of solution structures (one for each row in IU) containing all potentials and fluxes



ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

The program generates three figure windows with all potentials, fluxes and the polarization curve plotted.

By default, the program iterates over all cell voltages in steps of 50 mV.

The expected runtime on a modern PC is less than ten seconds for the default setup.

By default, moderate error tolerances are used (relative: 1e-4, absolute: 1e-6). Decrease these values (e.g., relative: 1e-6, absolute: 1e-10) for high precision results.
